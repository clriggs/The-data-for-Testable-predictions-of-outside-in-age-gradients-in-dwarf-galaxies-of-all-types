Here we store plots for all galaxies analyzed in "Testable predictions of outside in age gradients in dwarf galaxies of all types."
The folder "Fig-2-Plots" contains versions of Fig. 2 but for our entire simulated sample.

Each plot is named "r_age_simulation_haloID.pdf", where "simulation" and "haloID" are the simulation name and halo number, respectively.
